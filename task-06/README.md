At first I learned what is python virtual environment and created a venv. Then I installed all the packages mentioned under requirements then googled about beautiful soup.
Scraping the website to get the data was pretty simple by using requests module and beautiful soup. I inspected the site and found that the data that I want was inside two spacific classes and I extracted the text inside the classes and then it was only about printing it in proper lines as required and storing the data in a csv file.


Then I watch a YT video about building a discord bot and also read some docs which helped to learn how to make use of the discord.py module and all the commands related to that and how to read th user input and print the output in the discord.
I also learned about .env files and how to access the content in the .env file in python using dotenv and os modules. I stored my bot token in .env file in the same directory and completed the task.
