# HYPERTEXT MOCKUP LANGUAGE

This was a fun task. I learned the basis of html and css and created a website for Imagine Dragons according to the instructions given by the club.
I first learned the basic syntax of html and css, and started working on the main page of the website, making the images appear, creating the nav bar, it took some time. I customised thw main page and add all the links to Imagine Dragons' social media. Then I started working on the shop, this is where I learned about grids in css and implemented it.

The files 'New.html' and 'New.css' is for the main page i.e,'Home page' and the files 'Shop.html' and 'Shop.css' is the shopping site for their product.
