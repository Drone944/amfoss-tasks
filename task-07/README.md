This is where I learned about APIs. At first, I read the google docs about developing a chrome extention and created a manifest.json file.
I fetched the data using the api key in javascript and sent the required data to the html file by specifying the id and display all the required information.
Then I used css to change the background,font,font colour,shape and color of the search bar and button,etc.
