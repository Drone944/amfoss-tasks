# HELLO WORLD !

Python was easy since I had studied it in 11th and 12th grade. My logic was to create a list which contains 2 and append the numbers not divisible by the numbers in this list and print those numbers.
For Ruby I had to google the syntax and I used the same logic as above
I had studied Java in my 9th and 10th grade. For C,C++,java,javascript and go, I googled the syntax andI checked whether every number upto the given number is a prime number by dividing it with all the numbers till that number.
Elixir,Haskell and Rust were the hardest, since they have no loops, and I had to define multiple functions to emulate a loop and it took some time.
