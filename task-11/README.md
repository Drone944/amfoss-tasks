I found a video of a guy making a solar panel which always faces the sun except for at night. I understood his explanation and used a similiar concept and used the code block to code and turn the servo motor 90 degrees when the intensity of light is more than the threshold and viseversa, and the lcd screen attached to it show whether the roof is closed or open.
